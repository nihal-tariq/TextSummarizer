## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

- **Multi-format input**: Upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` files, or simply paste your text.
- **Robust text extraction**: Uses `PyPDF2` and `python-docx` for accurate text retrieval.
- **Smart preprocessing & tokenization**: Cleans text, removes noise (URLs, HTML tags, extra spaces), and tokenizes using `nltk`.
- **Powerful summarization**: Integrates the `T5-small` model from Hugging Face Transformers for meaningful summaries.
- **Keyword extraction**: Uses `RAKE` to generate relevant flashcard headings from summaries.
- **Resource management**: Efficient downloading and caching of NLP resources and model weights to optimize performance.
- **User-friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit for interactive, easy-to-use web interface.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Upload** your file or paste your text.
2. The app **extracts and cleans** the text content.
3. Text is **split into manageable sections**.
4. Each section is **summarized** using the T5 model.
5. Keywords are extracted to create **flashcard headings**.
6. You get neat, expandable flashcards for quick revision.
